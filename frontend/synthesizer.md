# Synthesizer Documentation

The Synthesizer is the core frontend of the Tokamak zk-EVM that converts Ethereum transactions into Tokamak zk-SNARK circuits. This documentation is organized into five main sections:

---

### 1. [Concepts](synthesizer/synthesizer-concepts.md)

**Start here if you're new to the Synthesizer**

Learn the fundamental concepts and high-level architecture.

### 2. [Execution Flow](synthesizer/synthesizer-execution-flow.md)

**Understand how transactions are processed**

Follow the step-by-step execution flow from transaction input to output file generation.

### 3. [Architecture](synthesizer/synthesizer-architecture.md)

**Deep dive into code structure and implementation**

Explore the detailed code architecture, core classes, and integration points with EthereumJS.

### 4. [Data Structures](synthesizer/synthesizer-data-structure.md)

**Master the core data types**

Understand DataPt, StackPt, MemoryPt, and Placement - the key data structures for symbol processing.

### 5. [Opcodes](synthesizer/synthesizer-opcodes.md)

**Reference guide for EVM opcode implementation**

Detailed opcode-by-opcode reference with circuit generation details and source code links.
